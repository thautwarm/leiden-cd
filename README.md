# leiden-cd: Leiden Community Detection Algorithm in .NET

A high-performance implementation of the Leiden algorithm for community
detection in networks. This implementation is designed for Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems without relying on heavy external dependencies like in
Python.

NOTE: This project is working in progress.

## Overview

The Leiden algorithm is an improved version of the Louvain algorithm for
community detection, offering better quality communities and guaranteed
well-connected communities.

This implementation focuses on:

- ðŸ“¦ Easy Integration with various tech stacks (via C# Native AOT compilation)
- ðŸš€ Performance optimizations: Less allocations & more parallelization
